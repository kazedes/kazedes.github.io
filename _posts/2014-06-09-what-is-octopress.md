Octopress is Jekyll blogging at its finest.

Octopress sports a clean responsive theme written in semantic HTML5, focused on readability and friendliness toward mobile devices.
Code blogging is easy and beautiful. Embed code (with Solarized styling) in your posts from gists, jsFiddle or from your filesystem.
Third party integration is simple with built-in support for Pinboard, Delicious, GitHub Repositories, Disqus Comments and Google Analytics.
It's easy to use. A collection of rake tasks simplifies development and makes deploying a cinch.
Ships with great plug-ins some original and others from the Jekyll community â€” tested and improved.
